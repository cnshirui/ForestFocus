# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for a Forest-style Pomodoro application for iOS. The primary requirement is to build a focus timer that helps users stay productive by growing virtual trees. The technical approach involves using SwiftUI for the user interface, SwiftData for local data persistence, and Combine for managing the timer and state changes.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Swift 5.9+
**Primary Dependencies**: SwiftUI, SwiftData, Combine, UserNotifications
**Storage**: SwiftData
**Testing**: XCTest, XCUITest
**Target Platform**: iOS 17+
**Project Type**: mobile
**Performance Goals**: 60 fps animations, <2s cold start, <50MB memory usage
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, no third-party dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, local data storage

**Constitution Check**

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Radically Simple**: Passed
- **Offline-First**: Passed
- **Test-First Development**: Passed
- **High Performance**: Passed
- **Accessibility**: Passed

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a standard iOS application structure, with a main application directory and a separate directory for tests.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
