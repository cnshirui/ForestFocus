# Feature Specification: Forest-Style Pomodoro App

**Feature Branch**: `001-forest-focus-app`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Forest-style Pomodoro app for iOS: start a 25-minute session to "plant" a tree that grows through 5 stages; cancel/quit kills the tree; completion saves it to a personal forest. Show countdown, pause/resume, local notification, and background-accurate timing. Store completed/abandoned sessions locally; show a forest grid and stats (total trees, total focus time, today's count, daily streak). Out of scope: custom durations, species, sync, sharing, watch, widgets."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start and Complete a Focus Session (Priority: P1)

A user wants to start a 25-minute focus session to stay productive. During the session, they can see a tree growing and a countdown timer. If they complete the session, the tree is added to their virtual forest.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application.

**Independent Test**: A user can start a session, wait for 25 minutes, and see the completed tree in their forest.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the user is on the main screen, **When** they tap the "Start Session" button, **Then** a 25-minute timer starts and a sapling appears.
2.  **Given** a session is in progress, **When** the timer is running, **Then** the tree visually grows through 5 distinct stages.
3.  **Given** a session is in progress, **When** the 25-minute timer completes, **Then** the user is notified, and the grown tree is saved to their forest.

### User Story 2 - Abandon a Focus Session (Priority: P2)

A user might get distracted and need to stop a focus session. If they cancel or quit the app during a session, the growing tree "dies" and is not added to their forest.

**Why this priority**: This reinforces the concept of staying focused and the consequence of giving up.

**Independent Test**: A user can start a session, cancel it before completion, and see that the tree is marked as "withered" and not added to their forest.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a session is in progress, **When** the user taps the "Cancel" button, **Then** the session ends, and the tree is marked as withered.
2.  **Given** a session is in progress, **When** the user quits the app, **Then** the session is considered abandoned, and the tree is marked as withered.

### User Story 3 - View Forest and Statistics (Priority: P3)

A user wants to see their progress and feel a sense of accomplishment. They can view their forest, which is a grid of all the trees they've successfully grown, and see statistics about their focus time.

**Why this priority**: This provides motivation and a sense of long-term achievement.

**Independent Test**: A user can navigate to the "Forest" screen and see a grid of their completed trees and their focus statistics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the user has completed at least one focus session, **When** they navigate to the Forest screen, **Then** they see a grid of their grown trees.
2.  **Given** the user has completed one or more focus sessions, **When** they view their stats, **Then** they can see the total number of trees, total focus time, today's tree count, and their daily streak.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the app is in the background when the timer finishes? (A local notification should be sent)
- What happens if the device is turned off during a session? (The session should be considered abandoned)
- What happens if the user pauses and resumes the session? (The timer should adjust accordingly)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

**Note:** All requirements must align with the project's constitution. Refer to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for the guiding principles.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to start a 25-minute focus session.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display a countdown timer during a session.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST visually represent a growing tree in 5 stages during a session.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow users to pause and resume a session.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST send a local notification when a session is complete.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST accurately track time even when the app is in the background.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST save completed sessions and their corresponding trees.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST mark sessions as abandoned if the user cancels or quits.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST display a grid of all successfully grown trees.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST display statistics: total trees, total focus time, today's tree count, and daily streak.
- **FR-011**: All session data MUST be stored locally on the device.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Session**: Represents a single focus session. Attributes: start time, end time, duration, status (completed, abandoned), associated tree.
- **Tree**: Represents the visual reward for a completed session. Attributes: growth stage, completion date.
- **Forest**: A collection of all successfully grown trees.
- **Statistics**: Aggregated data from all sessions. Attributes: total trees, total focus time, today's tree count, daily streak.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of users can successfully start and complete a focus session without errors.
- **SC-002**: The app maintains a smooth 60fps during the tree growing animation.
- **SC-003**: The app's cold start time is less than 2 seconds.
- **SC-004**: The timer's accuracy is within 1 second over a 25-minute session, even with backgrounding.
- **SC-005**: The app receives a 4.5+ star rating in the App Store after the first 1000 reviews.
