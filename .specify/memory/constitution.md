# ForestFocus Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Radically Simple
Keep the iOS Forest-style focus app radically simple. The user experience should be intuitive and clutter-free, focusing on the core task of focused work sessions.

### II. Offline-First
The application must be fully functional without an internet connection. All core features, including starting, stopping, and tracking focus sessions, must be available offline.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory. For every new feature, tests must be written first, reviewed by the user, and confirmed to fail before implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is to be strictly enforced.

### IV. High Performance
The application must feel responsive and fluid. All animations and transitions must maintain a consistent 60 frames per second. The application's cold start time must be under 2 seconds.

### V. Accessibility
The application must be usable by everyone. It must fully support VoiceOver for screen reading and Dynamic Type for adjustable font sizes.

## Governance

These principles are binding for all development on the ForestFocus project. Any proposed changes to the application that would violate these principles must be rejected. Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, a clear justification, and a migration plan if necessary.
